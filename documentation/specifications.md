# Project definition
Comppa is an project that will do lossless compression and decompression of textual files (most likely binary as well). There will be comparisons between the different algorithms, containing atleast the size of the resulting compressed file, as well as an comparison between the speed of compression and decompression using the different algorithms. If time permits, I will possibly look into compressing/decompressing binary files (images at least) and also using lossy compression algorithms.

## Features
* Compression and decompression of textual files utilizing several different algorithms

## Possible features
* Compression of binaryfiles / images
* Encryption
* Exploring lossy compression algorithms
  * Compare the size and speed of these in relation to the lossless algos

## Algorithms
* Will be added later
