# Time sheet
| Day        | Hours | Work done |
| ---------: | ----: | :-------- |
| 20.07.2020 | 2     | Reading course material, searching info about compressing, created repository |
| 24.07.2020 | 3     | Started coding |
| 25.07.2020 | 3     | Coded a bit more, Basic huffmancoding implemented |
| 28.07.2020 | 1     | Gradle configuration |
| 29.07.2020 | 2     | Gradle configuration, checkstyle |
| 31.07.2020 | 3     | Read & write binary files, refactored huffman to handle bytes |
| 02.08.2020 | 3     | Start working on bitarray class |
| 04.08.2020 | 3     | Finish bitarray class, create tests for it |
| 05.08.2020 | 1     | Started converting huffman to use bits instead of strings |
| 06.08.2020 | 3     | Expand bitarray class, with tests. create stub for bytebuffer |
| 07.08.2020 | 1     | Finish ByteBuffer, create tests for it |
| 08.08.2020 | 0.5   | Docstrings for HuffmanNode |
| 10.08.2020 | 0.5   | Add tests for HuffmanNode |
| 21.08.2020 | 3     | Peer reviewing of an another course project |
| 25.08.2020 | 2     | Started to implement storing of the huffman trie |
| 28.08.2020 | 3     | Peer reviewing of an another course project |
| 28.08.2020 | 2     | Fix bugs & refactor code |
| 28.08.2020 | 6     | Implemented encoding the huffman Trie as bytes, with tests |
| 29.08.2020 | 1     | Fix bug concerning creation of byte[] array from Bitarray bits |
| 29.08.2020 | 1     | Add test for Huffmantrie for bytes with a skewed distribution. The generation of a skewed distribution can probably be used for performance testing as well |
| 29.08.2020 | 4     | Cleanup testfiles, project structure, implement compressing+decompressing to file, create tests |
| 31.08.2020 | 2     | Continued with the same stuff as in the previous row |
| 02.09.2020 | 2     | Implement dynamic array (ArrayList) with the required methods and tests for it |
| 03.09.2020 | 8     | A lot of misc coding with own datastructures and other helpers, trying to fix bug in HuffmanEncoding |
| 04.09.2020 | 12    | Same again |
|            |       | |
| **Total**  |**72** | |
