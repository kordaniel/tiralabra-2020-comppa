# tiralabra-2020-comppa
This is a project that is created for the University of Helsinki course [_Aineopintojen harjoitusty√∂_](https://courses.helsinki.fi/fi/TKT20010/135568630). In short Comppa will be an software, that can be used to compress and decompress various files using different algorithms. It will also provide ways to compare both the results and speeds between the different algorithms. More info can be found in the documentation.

Comppa does not use any ready made data structures or algorithms, not from Java standard library or any other library. Everything will be implemented in pure Java from scratch, as this is one requirement for the course.
